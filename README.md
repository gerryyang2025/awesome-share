# Gerry's Blog

> üèóÔ∏è Jekyll-powered knowledge repository | üìù Dev tutorials ‚Ä¢ üéì English learning ‚Ä¢ ‚ú® Life logs

This is a personal blog built with **Jekyll**, serving as my curated knowledge repository. I document technical insights from software development, share practical strategies for English language learning, and reflect on meaningful life experiences. Through concise articles and tutorials, I aim to solidify my understanding while offering value to fellow developers, language learners, and curious minds exploring the intersection of technology and personal growth.

# Blog Philosophy

> "‰ªñÂ±±‰πãÁü≥ÔºåÂèØ‰ª•ÊîªÁéâ" (Stones from other hills may serve to polish the jade of this one)

This ancient Chinese proverb reflects my approach to learning and sharing knowledge. Every article, tutorial, and insight shared here is a stone that has helped polish my understanding, and I hope they can serve the same purpose for others.
